	******DRV8834 Dual-Bridge Stepper or DC Motor Driver****
	The motor driver is drv8835 Stepper Motor Controller IC
	DataSheet: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8834.pdf
	Connection port is Red Black Red Black from the outside
	
	M1		APHASE	BPHASE		RWHEEL		LWHEEL
	1		1		1			Forward		Forward
	1		1		0			Forward		Backward
	1		0		1			Backward	Forward
	1		0		0			Backward	Backward
	0		1		1			Forward		Forward (with slower speed??)

	From the IC STM32f103C8T6
	STM-----PIN---------PINonDRIVER-----NUM
	PA6		AENBL		nENBL/AENBL		10
	PA7		BENBL		STEP/BENBL		11
	PC15	APHASE		M0/APHASE		13
	PA0		BPHASE		DIR/BPHASE		12
	PC14	M1			M1				14

Cenz: I will use M1 to enable the slow move mode
PS: but if M1 is zero, the speed can still as high as not enable: what it is use for?
